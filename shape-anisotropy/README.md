# Shape Anisotropy

from 03.04. Shape Ansisotropy 

```python
from magnumnp import *  
import numpy as np
```

1) set up mesh, state, and demag field
2) loop over different magnetization angles and compute the demag energy
3) compare the computed energies with the analytical energy of an infinite plane
4) investigate the influence of the thin film's shape
